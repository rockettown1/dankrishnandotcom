Sometimes I'll pick up a paintbrush and think I'm an artist, sometimes I'll pick up a skateboard and forget my knees are 36 years old, and sometimes I'll have a problem with doing too many things at once. I enjoy anything that forces me to think, learn and solve problems. I currently work at a coding bootcamp where I focus on curriculum design, lead internal software projects and work with clients on their staff training needs.<br /> <br / > I live in Chester with my wife and have a dog called Xander (a long-haired Weimaraner because I'm sure you were wondering). I spend most of my time either learning new things, solving coding problems, building things, travelling or being walked by my dog üê∂`,

    written with React (client side, Next or Gatsby), most backend/API work I do is written for
    the Node.js ecosystem (e.g Express servers), and the cloud systems I am
    most familiar with are built with AWS services.
    <br /> <br />
    That being said, I am consistently trying to learn different technologies, and in the past have touched on languages such as Go, Java, Python & Swift. My day to day however is at the moment JS/TS (I'd be happy to change that though!).`,

    <br/><br/>
    Upon deciding to change careers into software engineering I joined Code Nation (a private training school) as a Senior Software Instructor, which seemed like a natural step as I was still able to teach (which I enjoyed a lot) but would be surrounded by code on a daily basis (which is what I wanted). I then moved from a senior instructor, to the managing instructor, and then to the Technical Director role where I now primarily work on curriculum design, internal software engineering and working with clients on talent needs.
